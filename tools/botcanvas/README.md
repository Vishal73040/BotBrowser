# BotCanvas Lab (Beta)

Canvas 2D/WebGL fingerprint forensics for BotBrowser. Capture every API call as a JSONL event stream for analysis and future replay capabilities.

---

## What Is BotCanvas?

BotCanvas is a comprehensive canvas recording system that captures all Canvas 2D and WebGL API calls with complete parameter serialization. The recorded JSONL format enables:

- **Forensic analysis** ‚Äì understand exactly how fingerprinting libraries build their hashes with the included HTML viewer
- **Deterministic testing** ‚Äì validate cross-platform consistency with identical API sequences
- **Hash reconstruction** ‚Äì upcoming replay feature in BotBrowser will restore canvas operations from recordings to reproduce identical hashes

> **[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Launch Live Replay Viewer](https://botswin.github.io/BotBrowser/tools/botcanvas/canvas_replay_viewer.html?jsonl=https://botswin.github.io/BotBrowser/tools/botcanvas/canvas_2d_simple_test_record.jsonl)** ‚Äî Interactive demo preloaded with sample JSONL. Scrub through events, view generated code, and watch canvas rendering in slow motion!

### Demo Resources

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[Sample Scene](../../docs/tools/botcanvas/canvas_2d_simple_test.html)** | Load it in BotBrowser, trigger the drawing routines, and create your own recording |
| **[Sample JSONL](../../docs/tools/botcanvas/canvas_2d_simple_test_record.jsonl)** | Reuse the hosted file or swap the `?jsonl=` query with your own URL |

## Quick Start: Recording Canvas 2D

**Step 1: Launch with recording enabled**
```bash
chromium \
  --bot-profile=/absolute/path/to/profile.enc \
  --bot-canvas-record-file=/tmp/botcanvas.jsonl \
  --user-data-dir="$(mktemp -d)"
```

**Step 2: Navigate and execute**
Visit your target site (or load a test scene) and trigger the canvas fingerprinting workflow you want to analyze.

**Step 3: Collect results**
Exit BotBrowser. The complete recording is saved to `/tmp/botcanvas.jsonl` in structured JSONL format.

## Recording Format & Capabilities

### Event Types

| Event Type | Description | Example Methods |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **`canvas_init`** | Canvas creation and initial sizing | Canvas element creation, dimensions |
| **`context_create`** | Context initialization with attributes | `getContext('2d')` with options |
| **`state`** | Property setters and style changes | `fillStyle`, `lineWidth`, `font`, `shadowBlur` |
| **`draw`** | Drawing and transformation operations | `fillRect`, `drawImage`, `transform`, `arc` |
| **`read`** | Data extraction and measurements | `getImageData`, `toBlob`, `measureText` |
| **`resize`** | Canvas dimension changes | `canvas.width/height` modifications |

### What Gets Recorded

‚úÖ **Complete parameter capture:**
- Primitive values (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Complex objects serialized by content:
  - `ImageData` ‚Üí base64 pixels + dimensions
  - `Path2D` ‚Üí command sequence arrays
  - `DOMMatrix` ‚Üí 6-element transforms
  - `CanvasGradient` ‚Üí ID + color stops
  - Image sources ‚Üí type + metadata

‚úÖ **Full return values:**
- Synchronous returns (`getImageData`, `measureText`)
- Callback results (`toBlob`)
- Promise resolutions (`OffscreenCanvas.convertToBlob`)

‚úÖ **Execution context:**
- Sequence numbers, timestamps, thread IDs
- Canvas IDs for multi-canvas scenarios
- Worker/offscreen canvas support

## Use Cases

| Scenario | How BotCanvas Helps |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Fingerprint Analysis** | Capture exact API sequences used by detection libraries to build canvas hashes |
| **Cross-Platform Validation** | Record on one OS, verify identical API calls reproduce on another platform |
| **Regression Testing** | Baseline recordings ensure consistent fingerprint behavior across BotBrowser updates |
| **Research & Documentation** | Archive real-world fingerprinting techniques with complete reproducibility |

## What's Coming in Q4 2025

### Canvas 2D Browser Replay (In Development)
The ability to load JSONL recordings directly in BotBrowser and reconstruct canvas operations:
- **Hash reconstruction** ‚Äì replay recorded canvas operations in BotBrowser to restore identical canvas hashes
- **Cross-platform validation** ‚Äì verify fingerprint consistency by replaying recordings on different OS/hardware
- **Regression testing** ‚Äì automated comparison of canvas outputs across browser versions

### WebGL Recording (In Development)
Same JSONL-based event capture extended to WebGL/WebGL2:
- Complete API call recording with parameter serialization
- Shader program capture (source + compilation metadata)
- Texture and buffer data serialization
- Integration with existing HTML viewer for forensic analysis
