# üî¨ BotBrowser Research Test Suite

Academic research framework for browser‚Äëcompatibility analysis.

Demonstrates controlled browser‚Äëcompatibility research using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests) for academic and security research purposes.

## üåê Research Environment Setup

All tests utilize **controlled network environments** with appropriate proxy configurations for academic analysis. Testing should be conducted through authorized institutional networks.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Academic Research Disclaimer

**For Educational and Research Institutions Only**

These research test scripts are provided strictly for **academic research, security analysis, and authorized educational purposes**. They are designed for **controlled research environments** within universities, research institutions, and authorized security testing facilities.

**Authorized Research Use Cases:**
- Browser compatibility studies in academic settings
- Security research under institutional oversight
- Educational demonstrations in controlled environments
- Authorized penetration testing with proper approvals

**Strictly Prohibited:**
- **Production system testing without explicit authorization**
- **Violation of website terms of service**
- **Unauthorized access to third-party systems**
- **Commercial exploitation without proper licensing**
- **Testing financial services without written authorization**
- **Using real user credentials or personal data**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Research Ethics Requirement:** All users must obtain proper institutional review board (IRB) approval and follow ethical research guidelines when conducting studies involving web services or user data.

### Test Data Policy

**All Test Scripts Use Only Synthetic/Invalid Data:**
- Random/generated usernames (not real accounts)
- Fake SSNs (e.g., "6789" ‚Äî obviously invalid)
- Non-existent email addresses
- Invalid credentials that will never authenticate
- Test endpoints and demo environments

**Never Use:**
- ‚ùå Real user accounts or credentials
- ‚ùå Valid personal information (SSN, DOB, etc.)
- ‚ùå Stolen or leaked credentials
- ‚ùå Production API endpoints without authorization

## üîß Getting Started

### Step 1: Research Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your configuration:

```bash
BOTBROWSER_EXEC_PATH=/absolute/path/to/botbrowser
BOT_PROFILE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/profile.enc
```

**Example Configuration:**
```bash
BOTBROWSER_EXEC_PATH=/usr/local/bin/chromium
BOT_PROFILE_PATH=/home/user/profiles/chrome139_win11_x64.enc
```

**Required Configuration:**
- `BOTBROWSER_EXEC_PATH` ‚Üí BotBrowser executable
- `BOT_PROFILE_PATH` ‚Üí Profile file (.enc file)

### Step 2: Install & Run Research Suite

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npx playwright test

# Generate analysis report
npx playwright show-report
```

## üìù Research Methodology

**Purpose:** Controlled compatibility‚Äëanalysis scripts for academic study.

**Framework:** All studies must be conducted within authorized environments that comply with institutional ethics guidelines, applicable laws, and protocols.

**Data Collection:** Collected only from publicly accessible testing interfaces and demonstration sites under controlled, non‚Äëproduction conditions.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Results from these tests must not be interpreted as instructions for bypassing production systems or circumventing security measures.

### Ethical Testing Guidelines

Before running any tests, ensure you meet ALL of these requirements:

1. ‚úÖ **Authorization:** You own the system OR have explicit written permission
2. ‚úÖ **Test Environment:** Using test/demo endpoints, not production systems
3. ‚úÖ **Synthetic Data:** No real user data or valid credentials
4. ‚úÖ **Legal Compliance:** Full compliance with applicable laws (CFAA, GDPR, etc.)
5. ‚úÖ **Terms of Service:** Not violating any website ToS
6. ‚úÖ **Academic Purpose:** Results used solely for research/education

**If you cannot check ALL boxes above, DO NOT proceed with testing.**

### Financial Services Testing ‚Äî Special Notice

Tests involving financial institutions (e.g., `threatmetrix.spec.ts` with Vanguard/Fidelity):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use ONLY publicly accessible "forgot password" or demo pages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Submit ONLY invalid/synthetic data (fake names, obviously invalid SSNs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT attempt actual authentication or account access
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Intended to demonstrate fingerprinting behavior in research context
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Production testing requires explicit written authorization from the institution

### Research Environment Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| üõë Network access restrictions | üîÑ Use authorized institutional network infrastructure |
| ‚ùå Tests failing | ‚úÖ Verify `.env` file paths and profile compatibility |
| üêõ Browser environment issues | üîß Check BotBrowser executable permissions and research environment setup |
